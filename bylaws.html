              <div>
                Section 6.01. Existence of Conflict, Disclosure. Directors,
                officers, employees, and contractors of the Organization should
                refrain from any actions or activities that impair, or appear to
                impair, their objectivity in the performance of their duties on
                behalf of the Organization. A conflict of interest may exist
                when the direct, personal, financial, or other interest(s) of
                any director, officer, staff member, or contractor competes or
                appears to compete with the interests of the Organization. If
                any such conflict of interest arises the interested person shall
                call it to the attention of the Board of Directors for
                resolution. If the conflict relates to a matter requiring board
                action, such person shall not vote on the matter. When there is
                a doubt as to whether any conflict of interest exists, the
                matter shall be resolved by a vote of the Board of Directors,
                excluding the person who is the subject of the possible
                conflict.
              </div>
              <div>
                Section 6.02. Nonparticipation in Vote. The person having a
                conflict shall not participate in the final deliberation or
                decision regarding the matter under consideration and shall
                retire from the room in which the Board is meeting.
              </div>
              <div>
                However, the person may be permitted to provide the Board with
                any and all relevant information.
              </div>

                vote and did not vote on the matter.
              </div>
              <div>
                Section 6.04. Annual Review. A copy of this conflict of interest
                statement shall be furnished to each director or officer,
                employee, and/or contractor who is presently serving the
                Organization, or who hereafter becomes associated with the
                Organization. This policy shall be reviewed annually for
                information and guidance of directors and officers, staff
                members and contractors, and new officers and directors, staff
                members and contractors shall be advised of the policy upon
                undertaking the duties of their offices.

                expenses and liabilities, including counsel fees, reasonably

                employee in connection with any threatened, pending, or
                completed action, suit or proceeding to which she/he may become
                involved by reason of her/his being or having been a member of
                the Board, officer, or employee of the Organization, or any
                settlement thereof unless adjudged therein to be liable for
                negligence or misconduct in the performance of her/his duties.
                Provided, however, that in the event of a settlement the
                indemnification herein shall apply only when the Board approves
                such settlement and reimbursement as being in the best interest
                of the Organization. The foregoing right of indemnification
                shall be in addition and not exclusive of all other rights to
                which such member of the Board, officer, or employee is
                entitled.
